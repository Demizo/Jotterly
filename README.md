<h1 align="center">Jot down anything without cluttering your notes app</h1>

Traditional note taking apps are meant to store organized **monolithic** notes. When you just want to **jot** down a *quick* fact or idea, finding the write place to put the information can be challenging. Does it *belong* in an **existing** note? Does it deserve a *whole* **new** note?

**Jotterly** streamlines jotting down facts and ideas without the hassle or clutter of managing **monolithic** notes...

Simply **Jot** something down and search for it later!
